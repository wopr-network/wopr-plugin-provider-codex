## Key Details

- Implements `ProviderPlugin` from `@wopr-network/plugin-types`
- Uses `@openai/codex-sdk` — check SDK docs before making API changes
- Configured via plugin config schema

## Plugin Contract

Imports only from `@wopr-network/plugin-types`. Never import from `@wopr-network/wopr` core.

## Issue Tracking

All issues in **Linear** (team: WOPR). Issue descriptions start with `**Repo:** wopr-network/wopr-plugin-provider-codex`.

## Session Memory

At the start of every WOPR session, **read `~/.wopr-memory.md` if it exists.** It contains recent session context: which repos were active, what branches are in flight, and how many uncommitted changes exist. Use it to orient quickly without re-investigating.

The `Stop` hook writes to this file automatically at session end. Only non-main branches are recorded — if everything is on `main`, nothing is written for that repo.
